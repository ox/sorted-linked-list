# Testplan for sl

A variety of test cases are prepared in the `main.c` file. They include the following cases:

  * Vanilla Test
    Create a sorted list, fill it with N items, iterate, destroy, assert that N number of items were returned.
  * Incomplete Iterator
    Same as vanilla, however iterate only over N-m items, where N > m > 0. Assert that only N-m items were traversed.
  * Multiple Iterators
    Create multiple iterators for a single sorted list with N items, traverse, ensure that N identical items are returned.
  * Multiple Iterators with Faulty Data Set
    Same as multiple iterators, except the data set is deleted before the second iterator starts.

All tests have no input, as it is generated, and are expected to return 1. The collective outputs are chained with `&&`
operations and the result is printed out, as well as returned. It can be viewed by running:

  $ echo $?

after the termination of the program.
